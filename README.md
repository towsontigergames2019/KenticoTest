# KenticoTest
Testing kentico

This is not the most efficient way to develop Kentico together, but this will do until an alternative is found. You may modify this repository.
Simply run this on Visual Studios and you can run Kentico via localhost. If you have any issues please contact me, Ana. The key should
already be in place and a blank webpage is already made. Feel free to play around with me and be sure to save any important changes you've 
made to this repo!!
